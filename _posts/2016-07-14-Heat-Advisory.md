### Hot Enough to Fry Your Brain on the Sidewalk?

Never mind frying eggs on the sidewalk,  today, July 14, 2016, will be hot enough to cause major health issues.  Baltimore City released a code red heat advisory warning that the temperature will feel like 105 degrees.

That means you should not leave anything alive in your car; even for a minute or two.

Cooling centers will be open for those who need them but not everyone enjoys them.

Good alternatives, places where you can sit in the air conditioning at someone else's expense,  include the library,  the movies, and the mall. In fact the mall is terrific because you can get your daily walk without passing out from the heat.

Drink plenty of water and make sure small children and the elderly are staying cool and hydrated.
