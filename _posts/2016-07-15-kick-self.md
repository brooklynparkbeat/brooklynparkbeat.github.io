### Get Your Art On at Artscape

Artscape swung into full gear today, beginning three days of amazement. This year's theme is Space: Explore What's Out There! There is so much going on that I am afraid if I start describing the program I will still be going when the thing closes. To make it a little easier you can download an app so you can easily access the program while you are there. You can also ride your bike there or take the Charm City Circulator, which should save you a bit of traffic/parking hassle. If you are concerned about accessibility issues, and who isn't at some point in their lives, you can download the accessibility guide. This year Artscape teamed up with Accessible Festivals to help accommodate all types of special needs. One final thought, Artscape is free, so you don't even need to scrape up any change to go.
